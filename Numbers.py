add = 1 + 2
subtract = 4 - 2
multiply = 3 * 4
divide = 7 / 4 #Returns the answer in a decimal number
divideWithRemainder = 7 % 4 #Modulo or Mod operator returns the remainder of the division operation
#Modulo can also be used to act as boolean to test if a number is even or odd
#
# ex. 50 % 2 = 0 since it is even
#
# ex. 27 % 2 = 1 there is a remainder of 1 telling us that it is an odd number
#
power = 2 ** 3 # ** tells us that the following number is an exponent; = 2 ^ 3 in basic math equations
